Final Software Design Document for The Gaming Room project.

## Journal Reflection - Module Eight

### Summary
The client, The Gaming Room, is a company with an existing Android-based game called *Draw It or Lose It*. They wanted to expand this game across multiple platforms using web-based technology. As their technology consultant, I created a software design document that outlined the architectural decisions, platform considerations, memory and storage management, and deployment strategies.

### What I Did Well
I feel that I clearly communicated the trade-offs of various operating platforms and explained memory and storage management in a way that would be easy for both technical and non-technical stakeholders to understand.

### Helpful Process
Working through the software design document before developing the code helped me identify necessary components ahead of time and made implementation much more straightforward.

### Revisions
If I could revise anything, I would improve the clarity of the Evaluation table and expand on the distributed systems explanation with more technical details.

### Interpreting User Needs
I made sure to translate the client’s needs into technical solutions — for example, by proposing a responsive HTML web interface to meet the requirement of cross-platform compatibility. Understanding the user's needs helped guide every decision in the design.

### Design Approach
I followed a top-down design process, starting with overall architecture and breaking it down into components. In the future, I would continue using system diagrams and templates early to shape my development work.
